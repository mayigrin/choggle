## What is Choggle?

Choggle is a combination of Chess and a word game. It plays for the most part like regular chess, but each piece also has a random letter associated with it. If at any point you see a word on the board (the tiles have to be adjacent but can connect in any direction, just like in Boggle), you can opt instead of moving a chess piece to submit the word. If the word is valid, you can add or remove a piece for you or your opponent. You win the game either when their king is mated, or when they have no piece left on the board.

## State of the Project

Still in progress; look through the commit history to see how far along I am. You're welcome to help build, just coordinate with me so we don't do double work.
